Most predictions, the further they go into the future, the less accurate they get, so don't knock on me for predicting something deranged or unreasonable. I'll be oversimplifying and over-generalizing the process, so I don't have to sit here and write 20 paragraphs about each potential phase. History doesn't necessarily repeat, but it most definitely rhymes, so here I go:¬†\n\nWe all know that the current geopolitical atmosphere is at its highest peak since the end of the Cold War, with Putin‚Äôs vision and goal possibly looking to reunite most if not all of the post-WW2 eastern European USSR-occupied countries once again along with the ongoing tension growing between Russia and Ukraine. It's pretty fair to say it's just a matter of time before he decides to fully move in for an invasion. With the latest build-up of Russia's military strength along Ukraine‚Äôs border, it wouldn't surprise me one bit if he gives the go anytime this month. I predict NATO, specifically the USA, responding to the invasion by only sending military aid (like it's currently doing) minus deploying American troops simply because Article 5 isn‚Äôt applicable to Ukraine. This will occur until either the fall of Kyiv, Russia occupying all of east Ukraine, or when Ukraine decides to surrender earlier before such things take place. At this point, the number of deaths caused by Russia could be approximately 50,000-100,000. The US and most of NATO will most likely not respond militarily, but I indubitably see them implementing massive sanctions on Russia, which will certainly cause economic pain primarily in Russia but also in most European countries predominantly in Germany since their so dependant on Russia for energy means, some industries in the west will as well face disruption. Much like when the Third Reich decided to invade Poland, I can‚Äôt see the US sending American troops overseas, especially given this administration's current approval rating and after spending 20 years in the Middle East gaining very little while China's economy grew to where it is today.\n\nAfter Ukraine becomes fully occupied by the Russians, I see the geopolitical atmosphere significantly intensifying but not leading to any significant military action between the world's superpowers besides sanctions continuing to be applied to the aggressors. Following this, I see Russia driving towards an established alliance with China to frighten NATO. This will back and encourage China to invade Taiwan, which they can do relatively easily and quickly even with American military aid being present in Taiwan. While China gets ready to invade after securing this alliance I can imagine Russia possibly setting up troops near Poland‚Äôs, Armenia‚Äôs, Romania‚Äôs and/or Moldova's border under the face of ‚Äúrunning military drills'' in a very similar fashion as how we previously saw in the Ukrainian-Belarus &amp; Russian situation. This historical moment will determine whether tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people die in the event of WW3. Taiwan's unique alliance with America means that if it decides to protect Taiwan, the Western, European, and other powers that make up NATO will probably be forced to make a life-or-death decision quickly to decide if they will try to help in the invasion of Taiwan or not. The longer they wait, the better positioned China gets for an invasion, and the higher the estimated casualty figure rises. The attempt in invading Taiwan could be very similar to the Normandy landings but on a much bigger scale, costing an estimated 250-500K American lives in just the first few weeks of battle, not to mention the civilian deaths. Ultimately, I'm positive most, if not all, nations will agree to not do such a thing and continue placing hard sanctions on both Russia and China until article 5 officially gets infringed in any of the NATO-backed countries.\n\n\tWhen it comes to dealing with the things the Russians and China are committing, I expect the West‚Äôs population to be in a very similar situation, both politically and ideologically, as we were pre-Pearl Harbor occurring. For the few that don't know, over 80%+ of Americans didn't support the US intervening in WW2 by sending American troops being sent out to war even 2 years into WW2. The next Pearl Harbor-like moment will in all likelihood be a cyberattack or terrorist-like bombing coming from either the Chinese or Russian government, this event will undoubtedly emotionally fuel most of America‚Äôs population into agreeing to enter or start WW3.

Russian military is defeated and their economy is shattered.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIts April. NATO members see their chance to remove Putin from power and end their reliance on Russia's natural resources.\n\nThe US and her NATO allies go on the offensive and invade Russia. The Russians are steam rolled as they were unprepared for such an attack.\n\nRussians burns all their land and destroy their roads as the allies drive east towards Moscow. Dedicated Russian civilians and military act as a rearguard as the general population flees, causing significant delays and casualties. Resistance is met at every major city. Occupation proves futile, being too costly and ineffective.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAllies reach Moscow late summer but find a well dug in and fortified capital city. A long and costly siege begins. The allies expecting a weak and demoralized Russian military is surprised and repelled by fierce resistance. Defending your home is more motivating than taking somebody else's.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelarus starts attacking NATO supply chains and another front in the war is opened. The allies, hoping to skirt around Belarus and attack through Ukraine now have to contend with another nation. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWinter is coming.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRussian and Chinese men and material arrive from the east. The US urges her allies in Japan and South Korea to attack China to distract and weaken her. \n\nBut these nations are too small to take on the behemoth that is now China. They do nothing. Australia approaches from the south but their navy is ineffective. Should've went with French hardware.\n\nChina does not launch attacks of her own but is instead content to hold her ground on her eastern and southern flank. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFrustrated, running low on supplies and morale, the Allies start blaming each other for the delays and failures. Communications and military cohesion break down. They launch uncoordinated and ineffective small scale attacks. \n\nDesperate, the Allies launch one last attempt to take Moscow. Russians citizens willingly sell their lives in defiance.\n\nReinforcements arrive and easily see the attackers off. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWinter is here. \n\nSensing the tides have turned, the Allies make a poorly coordinated retreat. The ground is a quagmire. The roads still broken. The whole of the Allied attack force is bottlenecked, having to travel through Ukraine.\n\nThe Russians catch up. Stragglers are cut down, their meager supplies taken. \n\nThe great northern European plain makes invading an easy task. Slowly, smaller countries surrender. Russians invade Poland's plains in a day. Germany surrenders and casts their lot with the Russians. \n\nThe French hastily reinforce the historic but still effective Maginot Line. However, this gets swept away. French Resistance is no match for the Russian Rampage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe last remaining great power in Europe is Britain. Her geographical features make her an impenetrable island fortress. \n\nRussia uses her defeated foe's men and material to wear down Britain. Reluctant pilots and soldiers are press-ganged into fighting. The lives of their loved ones threatened. Russia targets the military airfields and infrastructure. Britain launches attacks on civilian targets but Putin does not take the bait.\n\nWith little naval and air defense left, Russia's little green men land on the beaches. The Brits fight and resist at every level. But it is not enough. Having the military resource of a continent thrown at an island is too much to defend against. After fierce resistance, the UK capitulates. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe US is the last bastion of hope and democracy.

This war could last for months. You overestimate the factor of domestic support. Russia surely is sending more and more troops and has some more unexpected tricks in the sleeve.","content":"I truly hope I am mistaken, but this is the situation from the inside of Russia the way I see it. It's a bit depressive.\n\nAs a Russian, I think most of you overestimate the factor of domestic support. People in Russia would not protest. Kill half of the army that has gathered around the borders of Ukraine - our streets will be empty. These unlucky mothers are all scattered across this huge country and will be unable to form any protest groups. Instead there will be huge lines to withdraw cash from ATM's. For the past 22 years Russia has created such a mythological way of thinking inside Russian brains that no logic could overcome it. Whole population was traumatized after the USSR collapse, and then later was fed with such nonsense in order to cope with pain that 90% of people are in an astonishing amount of denial here. Russia is ready to sacrifice as much soldiers as needed in order to achieve all these armchair geopolitical goals. Russians think this is a sacred war against Nazis, and this country is used to throw young bodies into war machines. Doesn't matter many will die. Women will give birth to new soldiers. Russia does not suffer casualties. Russia enjoys them. \n\nI doubt Russia thought they will capture Ukraine in a few days. They knew it's a huge country. As many of you note Russia has only sent around 30% of the army. More are on the way. In their way of thinking, Ukraine must fall at any price. All these huge columns with MLRS - who do you think it will be targeted at? Ukrainian army standing in an open field? All these huge lines of tanks piling up? You think it will be used against Ukrainian tanks? Heavy flamethrowers systems? How exactly were they planning to use that WMD-like weapon? I am afraid all these things will be used to destroy Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. What Russia truly needs is a dead land to ensure that this country will have no future for the next 20 years. It's a punishment because they misbehaved. In Russia we say \"—Ç–∞–∫ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—å—Å—è–∂ –Ω–∏–∫–æ–º—É\" - means \"if I can't get you, no one will\". It means that I will destroy you so no one will ever have you. You can't possibly imagine the amount of Russian fixation about Ukraine. Russia is a crazy borderline stalker and they can't get over. It can only be stopped with brutal force. This is a pill that is really hard to swallow for US and EU.\n\nToday the Russian president said that Western \"sanctions are not legitimate\". Is that even a sentence? They went so deep down into their echo chamber they no longer make sense. They still report 0 losses. Today Russian president also ordered Russian deterrence forces that include nuclear missiles to switch to a special mode of service - basically they are now more ready. While it's purely a propaganda, it also shows that they are ready to escalate as much as needed. And they will. If they realize they are failing in Ukraine, God knows what comes to their mind. They will truly believe it's because some blackwater/academi is fighting in Donbass, and NATO soldiers are also helping to defend Kyiv. They will actually think they are already fighting with American soldiers and it's time to strike back.\n\nRussia has always been full of tricks. The next step will surprise you. Even if all these tricks fail they will seek revenge and will do everything to find the means in order to punch you in the face. Beware of that. Ukraine must fight fiercely if they want to survive. EU must act decisively if they don't want to have another Syria literally zero kilometers from them. US has all the power to fight a raging war without a bullet fired if they want to actually help.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2r1yb/analysis_as_a_russian_i_want_to_warn_everyone/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977636192,"author":"reddit:ukraine/KillerDonuts27","title":"Warning to Ukrainian citizens","content":"NDSC secretary Danilov warns citizens in Bucha do not take any buses \"for evacuation\" as Ukrainian authorities not conducting such, it is Russian operation to take hostages  https://liveuamap.com//en/2022/27-february-ndsc-secretary-danilov-warns-citizens-in-bucha","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2r3gh/warning_to_ukrainian_citizens/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977636192,"author":"reddit:ukraine/ForgetThisNickname","title":"To sane Russians","content":"(In my previous posts of this someone kindly translated this into russian, see below)\n\nThis is addressed to any Russian involved in fights on Ukraine, to frontline soldiers, to Russians at home whose sons, husbands and friends are dying on Ukraine, to anyone who can do little something to make this stop.\n\nThis is complete madness.

Czechoslovakia 1968. Nikagda nezabudim.\n\nI will leave this to live it‚Äôs own life. I won‚Äôt respond comments and messages. Hopefuly it can reach at last someone.  \n\n\\- Random guy from the internet\n\nAmmend: I‚Äôve posted this into threads and comments few times before, but there is one more thing to say. Donetsk and Luhansk are very complicated matter, but if there were any Ukraine wrongdoings on Russian people or even genocide going on (according to Russian leaders), we do have international institutions and ogranizations to prevent that. First step would be to collect all possible evidence and demand United Nations to dispatch blue helmets (and that‚Äôs only one of many possibilities). Russian leaders has never intended to do so, instead they‚Äôve fabulated and mystified and used this as spark for a war to gain complete political control of milions and milions of people and territory. It happened before, remember Franz Ferdinand D‚ÄôEste or Gleiwitz. It‚Äôs just a very weak excuse for commiting war crimes on civilians, schools and hospitals. This is not helping those in need, this is sacrificing them for higher goals. Russian president has never cared and never will. He is hidding behind backs of soldiers and even dragging other nations (Chechnya, Belarus, he even tried Kazakhstan) into fighting for his pleasure.\n\nAlso I do agree that western world is far from ideal, but armies of NATO are there to protect its members, not to attack across someone elses borders. It was not NATO trying to recruite Ukraine into its ranks, Ukraine hoped for membership in desperate need of guarantee of staying in peace with all its neighbours, Russia including. It‚Äôs not important if solution is being neutral or EU or NATO, whatever it takes, let borders of all involved countries stay undisturbed and let nations decide their own future.   \n \n\nPS: Anyone who wants to copypaste this, feel free to do so.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\n–≠—Ç–æ –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫–æ –≤—Å–µ–º —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–º, —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º –≤ –±–æ—è—Ö –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ, –∫ —Ñ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤–∏–∫–∞–º, –∫ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–º –¥–æ–º–∞, —á—å–∏ —Å—ã–Ω–æ–≤—å—è, –º—É–∂—å—è –∏ –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è –≥–∏–±–Ω—É—Ç –Ω–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ, –∫–æ –≤—Å–µ–º, –∫—Ç–æ –º–∞–ª–æ —á—Ç–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ. –≠—Ç–æ –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–µ –±–µ–∑—É–º–∏–µ. –í—ã –≤–µ–¥–µ—Ç–µ –≤–æ–π–Ω—É –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –≤–µ—â–µ–π, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –Ω–µ—Ç, –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ. –£ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –µ—Å—Ç—å –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ —É–≤–∞–∂–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –∏ –±—É–¥—É—Ç —Å–æ–±–ª—é–¥–∞—Ç—å—Å—è, –Ω–∏ –æ–¥–Ω–æ –∑–∞–ø–∞–¥–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –Ω–µ –∑–∞–º—ã—à–ª—è–µ—Ç –∏—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ—á—å, –Ω–µ —Å–∞–±–æ—Ç–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –∏ –Ω–µ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—É—Å–∫–∞–µ—Ç –≤–∞—à—É —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—É. –≠—Ç–∞ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω—É—Ç–æ–π –Ω–∞–≤—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞. –≠—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –°–®–ê, –ù–ê–¢–û –∏–ª–∏ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–µ–π—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–æ—é–∑. –í–∞—à–µ —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –æ–±–º–∞–Ω—É–ª–æ –≤–∞—Å. –¢—ã –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–µ –∑–Ω–∞–µ—à—å, –∑–∞—á–µ–º —Ç—ã –∑–¥–µ—Å—å. –ï–¥–≤–∞ –ª–∏ 20-–ª–µ—Ç–Ω–∏–µ –¥–µ—Ç–∏ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç –∏ —É–º–∏—Ä–∞—é—Ç –≤ —á—É–∂–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–µ –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω–æ –Ω–∏ –∑–∞ —á—Ç–æ. –ù–µ—Ç –Ω–∏–∫–∞–∫–æ–π –≤—ã–≥–æ–¥—ã –æ—Ç —ç—Ç–æ–π –≤–æ–π–Ω—ã.\n\n–í–∞—à–∏ —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥–∏ –Ω–µ–∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º—ã –∏ —Å—É–≤–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω—ã —Å —á–µ—Ç–∫–æ –æ—á–µ—Ä—á–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º–∏ –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞–º–∏ –∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç —Å–∞–º–∏ —Ä–µ—à–∞—Ç—å —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Å–≤–æ–µ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ. –ü—Ä–∏ –ª—é–±—ã—Ö –æ–±—Å—Ç–æ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∞—Ö –æ–Ω–∏ —Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω–∏—Ç—å –≤–∞–º –≤—Ä–µ–¥ –∏–ª–∏ –∑–∞–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∞–¥–ª–µ–∂–∏—Ç –≤–∞–º. –û–Ω–∏ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ —Ö–æ—Ç—è—Ç –±—ã—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω—ã–º–∏, –Ω–µ –±—É–¥—É—á–∏ –æ—Ä—É–¥–∏–µ–º –±–µ–∑—É–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —ç–≥–æ–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã, –º–µ—á—Ç–∞—é—â–µ–≥–æ –≤–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –¥–∞–≤–Ω–æ —É—à–µ–¥—à—É—é –∏–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏—é. –ò–º–ø–µ—Ä–∏—è, –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤—à–∞—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –∏—Ö –≤–æ–ª–∏. –ü–æ—Ä–∞ –∏—Ö –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å. –ù–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ –¥—Ä—É–∂–∏—Ç—å –Ω–µ–ª—å–∑—è. –í—Å–µ–≥–¥–∞. –£ –≤–∞—à–∏—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ª—É—á—à–µ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –≤—ã –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –∑–∞—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∞—Ç—å. –≠—Ç–æ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∑–∞—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –≤–µ—Å—å –º–∏—Ä –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏–¥–µ—Ç—å –≤–∞—Å, –∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –∫ –≤–∞–º –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ –Ω–µ –±—É–¥—É—Ç –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç—å—Å—è —Ç–∞–∫ –∂–µ. –ö–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–∏–Ω –≤–∞—à–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—ã –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∫–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å –∂–µ—Å—Ç–∫–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Ä–∞—Å—Å—É–¥–∫–∞–º–∏ –≤ –º–∏—Ä–µ, –∞ –≤–∞—à–µ–º—É –ø—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—É –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –≤—Å–µ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ, –∫–∞–∫ –µ–º—É —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ. –¢—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—à—å –ª—É—á—à–µ. –í—ã —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞ –≤ –Ω–∞—É–∫–µ, –∏—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–µ, —Å–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–µ –∏ –≤–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—è—Ö, –Ω–æ –Ω–µ —Å –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º, –≤–µ–¥—É—â–∏–º –≤–∞—Å –≤ –∞–¥. –í—ã –≤—Å–µ –µ—â–µ –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏—Ç–µ —ç—Ç–æ –≤ —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö —Ä—É–∫–∞—Ö. –ü—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –∏–¥–∏—Ç–µ –¥–æ–º–æ–π –∏ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é, —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞–≤–∞—è –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞, –æ—Ç –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –≤–∞—à–∞ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –∏–∑–≤–ª–µ—á—å –≤—ã–≥–æ–¥—É, –∞ –Ω–µ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∂–∞—è, —Å–æ–∫—Ä—É—à–∞—è –∏ —É–≥–Ω–µ—Ç–∞—è –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏—Ö. –í—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª–∏ —ç—Ç–æ –∏ —Å –º–æ–µ–π —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–π, –∏ —ç—Ç–æ –¥–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–º –æ–±–æ—à–ª–æ—Å—å. –ß–µ—Ö–æ—Å–ª–æ–≤–∞–∫–∏—è 1968. –ù–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ–∑–∞–±—É–¥–∏–º.\n\n–Ø –æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª—é —ç—Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∂–∏—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–µ–π —Å–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω—å—é. –ù–∞ –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–∏ –∏ —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–µ –æ—Ç–≤–µ—á–∞—é. –ù–∞–¥–µ—é—Å—å, —ç—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–∫–æ–Ω–µ—Ü –¥–æ –∫–æ–≥–æ-—Ç–æ –¥–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç.\n\n\\- –°–ª—É—á–∞–π–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞—Ä–µ–Ω—å –∏–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç–∞\n\n(–≠—Ç–æ –Ω–µ –±—ã–ª–æ —á–∞—Å—Ç—å—é –æ—Ä–∏–≥–∏–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–∞, –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É —è –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≤–µ–ª —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é Google, –∏–∑–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ –∑–∞ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω—ã–µ –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∏.)\n\n–ü–æ–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞: —è —É–∂–µ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —Ä–∞–∑ –ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞–ª —ç—Ç–æ –≤ —Ç–µ–º–∞—Ö –∏ –∫–æ–º–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∏—è—Ö, –Ω–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å –µ—â–µ –æ–¥–Ω–∞ –≤–µ—â—å, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ —Å–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç—å. –î–æ–Ω–µ—Ü–∫ –∏ –õ—É–≥–∞–Ω—Å–∫ -

We are 6 people, two children, my wife and I and my wife's parents.\n\n I decided to fill up the car with gas, I usually drive on propane and don't use much gas, but I still need it to start the car and switch to propane.\n\n We stood for about an hour all together at the gas station, but the line did not move.  I decided to return to the shelter, the news reported that they were opening.\n\n All morning we were engaged in arranging a shelter, carrying benches, chairs, seats, building places for shelter.\n\n At 11 o'clock there were not many of us, about 50 people.  By evening we were over 200 people.\n\n People are praying.  Fear.

So read and spread these simple rules: \n\n1. Don't walk the streets in a war zone. You risk becoming a victim of accidental shelling.\n\n2. Do not film the fighting while standing at the window. In the case of close explosions, you may be injured or even killed by an accidental shard or shards of glass knocked out by the shock wave.\n\n3. Do not try to interfere with moving vehicles or people with weapons. Even if you are very confident in yourself. Even if you think you can handle it easily.\n\n4. Do not try to fire at the military, even if you have received a weapon. In fact, if you are a civilian, you have no right to participate in hostilities. If you can't wait to fight - first get a legal status - join the army. But just don't attack the military, no matter which side they belong to.\n\n5. Do not risk your life in order to make a fascinating report. There are a lot of videos on the web right now where people literally climb into the very line of fire in order to shoot an exciting video. Your life is one, it's not computer games. Don't risk it unnecessarily.\n\n6. If you observe that the military, their armored vehicles or any equipment of any of the parties to the conflict are located next to you - go as far away as possible and as soon as possible, or find a safe haven. There is a high probability that this place will become a target for artillery fire or a bomb attack.\n\n7. Categorically avoid any places of mass gatherings of people. Avoid people with guns even more. Stay away from them and try not to show them in their eyes in any case. Remember that the effective radius of aiming small arms fire is 400-800 meters. Now a lot of weapons in Kiev have been distributed to random people. Anyone could be among them. It can be bandits, drug addicts, looters. So avoid meeting such people.\n\nPlease stay safe, we have to survive the current events. All together. Take care of yourself and your loved ones.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t1b2s8/my_appeal_to_civilians_in_ukraine/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977636579,"author":"reddit:russia/Bagration44","title":"Ukrainians if you are injured and need medical assistance and hospital near you are unavailable, raise your hands at all time and walk slowly towards Russian line, communicate and shout \"injury\"","content":"Do not do that in a combat situation or firefight.\n\nRussian medical unit will take care of you in their capacity and help you.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/russia/comments/t1bvhx/ukrainians_if_you_are_injured_and_need_medical/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977636579,"author":"reddit:russia/Bagration44","title":"Kiev and Kharkiv( two of Ukraine largest cities) will be siege in the coming days.

Our enemy is those who plundered the country and destroyed the population in favor of the West.\n\nOrdinary residents of Ukraine are not our enemies, but our brothers!\n\nREMEMBER:\n\nA Russian soldier NEVER fights with civilians.\n\nA Russian soldier NEVER covers himself with civilians.\n\nA Russian soldier will ALWAYS protect and help.\n\nOUR CAUSE IS RIGHT, THE ENEMY WILL BE DEFEATED, UKRAINE WILL BE FREE!\n\nRULES OF CONDUCT:\n\n1. If you see people with weapons, military equipment - stay away from them. If you need to get close to them, wave your arms, attract attention to yourself and follow the orders of the military. This will ensure your safety.\n\n2. Do not approach armored vehicles: you may simply not be noticed from the inside.\n\n3. If you have a weapon, keep it at home, do not take it outside. Otherwise, you may be mistaken for a saboteur, robber or marauder. Use weapons only to protect the life and health of yourself and your loved ones, if there is no other way out.\n\n4. Form mutual aid units. Chat with your neighbors.\n\nGo outside only in groups and only if necessary.\n\n5. Do not move around unknown areas.\n\n6. Drive the car carefully, at a speed of 40-50 km / h. Don't move anywhere unless absolutely necessary. Turn on the interior light at night so that you can be seen.\n\n7. Make sure that the children do not go outside and are always with you.\n\n8. Know where the nearest sources of drinking water and food are,\n\nmedicines (shops, pharmacies, water supply). If you are constantly taking\n\nmedications, keep them in stock for a week.\n\n9. If possible, call your family, friends and acquaintances,\n\ntell them about the situation around you. This will show you that you are alive.\n\nIF YOU HEAR SHOOTING AND EXPLOSIONS, you need to go to a room without windows: a basement,\n\na bathroom or toilet, a stairwell and wait until the shooting and shots are\n\nover. Then wait another 15 minutes. Only then can you look out the window.\n\nIF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS LOCATED AND FIRING NEAR YOUR HOUSE ‚Äì\n\nLEAVE YOUR HOUSE IMMEDIATELY AND MOVE AWAY!\n\nIF YOU NEED WATER, FOOD OR MEDICAL HELP ‚Äì\n\nPLEASE CONTACT THE RUSSIAN SOLDIERS. THEY WILL HELP YOU FOR FREE.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupplement from the OP: Dear citizens of Ukraine.

They are blowing up bridges, which will cause a logistical collapse and lead to a humanitarian catastrophe. \n2. They distribute weapons absolutely uncontrollably, which has already led to casualties among the population and a sharp increase in crime. \n3. They have heavy armored vehicles and artillery in residential areas, provoking retaliatory strikes - this will undoubtedly lead to a large number of civilian casualties. \n4. Ukrainian resources are now busy spreading a huge number of fakes. \n5.

Many \"russian soldiers\" are actors from the Ukrainian army, or even random Russian civilians living in Ukraine, most of these videos are fake, of course. \n\nBut there really are a couple of videos with real Russian soldiers. And they all have one thing in common: the brutal aggression on the part of the Ukrainians towards the prisoners. They are beaten, humiliated and insulted.\n\nI understand that it is useless to point out to you such things as humanity, or the rules for the treatment of prisoners of war, fixed in the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War. \n\nI'm just asking you to realize that your cruel treatment of unarmed prisoners does not go unnoticed. In addition to the obvious media damage to your image of \"defenders of the country\" (it is quite difficult to sympathize with a pack of aggressive baboons beating an unarmed or wounded person), you endanger your own soldiers.\n\n How soon do you think your prisoners will receive the same treatment?\n\nOrdinary people are fighting on both sides.

I give him less than 3 months.","content":"This isn't an election, so his approval rate amongst Russian pensioners and boomers isn't relevant. The country doesn't support his war  - just look at the protests against it from Novosibirsk to St Petersburgh. It's important to notice that only the bravest people go out and raise their voices in Russia because of the oppression. The protests in Russia that you see in the news are just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nTomorrow, on Monday, a brand new kind of shitstorm will begin. Outside the country the price of Rubel will crash, causing even bigger problems for their economy. Inside, there's a great chance that the financial system and the banks will grind to a halt due to people panicking in just a matter of days. That, on top of getting banned from SWIFT will be disastrous. They will be finding it eerily familiar from the 1980s: scarcity of goods, produce, everything.  A great deal of just about nothing to buy in the Gum Univerzalniy Magazin.\n\nSoon, the wealthy people of the Russian society will realize that days of power, wealth, and prosperity are over. They are out of luck. Not only they are losing their properties, investments abroad, not only they can't escape anymore from the harsh and depressing Russian reality to a tropical island, but they are losing their internal market as well.\n\nThis is when networks will be playing a vital role. These people of economic power will find their way to officers of the Russian Army. They will start talking. Lots of news already showed that the morale in Putin's army is probably very low. Putin must know this too, that's why he was aiming for a Blitzkrieg. But these are Russians, not Germans. Russian soldiers living under circumstances most people living in the west can't even imagine. \n\nThe Blitzkrieg didn't happen and Ukraine can cause damage to Russian troops most of us didn't even dare to believe. They are failing on massive, unimaginable levels.\n\nToday, as it's been quite likely, he put their nuclear forces on high alert. This will turn up the protests internally, the sirens will go off even in some military men's head, while not even shaking the unity of the west the tiniest bit. No one will blink an eye. More protests will bring on more oppression, police forces will be overwhelmed soon, while still being underpaid, living in near poverty.\n\nEconomic elite will quickly find the common interests with the military elite. Someone will flip. And then more. On high levels. Putin will start to act like a loose cannon, firing at everyone and anyone. Then on the nicest day in 2022, he will be overthrown. From a rock solid position, just because he underestimated how much the world hates fucking nazis.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2ra1n/the_end_is_near_for_putin_i_give_him_less_than_3/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977866448,"author":"reddit:ukraine/madlass_4rm_madtown","title":"True colors","content":"We are beginning to see the true colors of many people, like Musk getting Starlink going for Ukraine, what are some other examples you are seeing?","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2raus/true_colors/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645977876836,"author":"reddit:CombatFootage/Ryanskillz","title":"Where is the advanced Russian equipment?

This is a follow up to the post I did back on Friday about a piece of software I've built to help displaced Ukrainian citizens quickly find out if their loved ones are safe.\n\nTool is here: https://www.amisafe.info/\n\nLast post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t125ne/i_built_a_simple_page_for_ukraine_to_help_you_let/\n\nSince Friday there have been a number of updates based on recommendations from the community. Hopefully this helps to make the system more usable (and more fit for real purposes). Chiefly among these:  \n\n\n1. Higher level of security. This includes disabled server side network logging, proxying through Cloudflare and end to end encryption through SSL.\n2. Dark mode by default. It became clear that many would like to be able to use this application discreetly. This has been done.\n3. Ukrainian language support by default. If there are any Ukrainian speakers out there who wish for me to make any revisions to the language areas of the tool, please give me a DM.\n4. Server reset information. The system now tells you when the server last reset so that you are aware of when you need to recreate your user (in the case of a server reset).\n\nAs before. The software is entirely open source so you can review its credibility. My DMs are also always open for proof of my identity as well. Please review the previous reddit post for information about the code repositories if you want to contribute to this project yourself.\n\nI really hope this tool supports some of you well. If only one family finds some use from this, it will be worth it.\n\nPlease stay safe.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2rivt/update_to_the_tool_i_built_to_help_ukrainians/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645978486681,"author":"reddit:russia/erta_ale","title":"Western outlook towards students taken hostage.
