But, Putin had more negotiating power when he was holding training exercises. Invading was a massive tactical error predicated on Putin's autocratic belief that removing Ukrainian leadership would somehow end any Ukrainian resistance. He operated under the assumption that Ukrainian identity was largely tied to the Orthodox Church and that they were uninterested or widely dissatisfied with Kiev. \n\nAt the same time, Ukrainians found Russian invasion plans bizarre after decades of seeing everyday Russians as their friends and neighbors. The war to them is an unnecessary and heinous affront and a violation their friendship with the Russian people that continued even after Putin's occupation of Ukraine territory and multiples attempts to assassinate Ukrainian leaders. \n\nFinally - Putin's assumption that he could roll in and take over as he did in 2014 is even more misguided when you consider Ukrainian outrage at his continued support of separatists and Ukrainian support of their own armed forces. Putin is arming and facilitating the killing of Ukrainians while at the same time professing to liberate them - and everyone in Ukraine knows this.\n\nAnyone who has ever talked to a Ukrainian knows they are vocally \"not Russian.\" They have their own cultural and ethnic identity. Furthermore, the history of Soviet invasion, mass murder, and mass starvation is no longer ignored in Ukrainian schools. Ukrainians also have uninhibited internet access and are not ignorant to reality. Violating Ukrainian sovereign territory has only galvanized longstanding issues of Ukrainian identity, brought back historical memory of Soviet-era mass murder, and led to mass support for the Ukrainian government. \n\nPutin's tactical error will undoubtedly guarantee a protracted insurgency even if he accomplishes his only war aim of capturing and assassinating of Ukrainian government figures. After lying for months, violating international agreements, and murdering Ukrainian citizens, any attempt at negotiating with Putin is absurd for any Ukrainian or other world leader. I think this forces Putin to do one of two things - retreat and face a militant pro-NATO and anti-Russian Ukrainian populace (his self-created nightmare) - or escalate war aims.","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2pk1u/the_ninth_directorate_of_the_fifth_service_of/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645973226437,"author":"reddit:ukraine/gusarking","title":"The world's biggest cargo jet – Antonov An-225 Mriya is destroyed due to Russian attack.","content":"AN-225 \"Mriya\" is the largest and most powerful transport aircraft in the world, created by the Antonov Design Bureau in Kyiv.

It's a really tough time in Ukraine right now. ❤  \n\n\nBefore, let's see what Russia wants from Ukraine. If you don't know, the Soviet Union died 30 years ago, so Putin wants to reform it. But that's actually impossible. Putin said he wants to split Ukraine in two different states. One with the capital at Kyiv, and it's president being a Russian Guy, and another one with the president being Zelenskyy. Now, Russia wants to negotiate with Ukraine in Belarus, but Zelenskyy says no. Because Belarus stands with Russia and they can kill him. Zelenskyy said that he wants to negotiate with Russia in a different country. One of them being Turkey, because it's 10x safer than Belarus. Which I agree.  \n\n\nPutin also said today that Poland is a gift from Stalin years ago, when Soviet Union existed. Which makes me think wtf. Really. This man probably has mental problems. Imagine if Russia attacks Poland now, because of what this dictator said. Wow. World War 3 will start, cause NATO Members will defend Poland, since Poland is a NATO Member.   \n\n\nUS wants to freeze Russia's economy. Adidas, Nike, Intel, AMD, and other big brands stopped shipping to Russia. I also forgot to mention food. Yeah, they've stopped shipping food too. Russian Troops robbed banks, shops from Ukraine since they've lost so much money in this \"War\".  \n\n\nPutin said like right now, that he might start attacking Ukraine with Nuclear Weapons. For real no. That's really bad. If this Nuclear Weapons will be used, million of people will die, and million of places will get destroyed. That's really stupid and silly to do.   \n\n\nThat's most I know, I'll update you later, if there's anything new.   \nThanks!","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2pnlf/everything_we_know_so_far/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645973226437,"author":"reddit:ukraine/undark83","title":"Disabling abandonded russian tanks with fire","content":"If the hatch is open throw petrol and wood down into the cockpit then light it on fire.

In addition, the individual I speak to in the current remark in question is not the Ukrainian President but Yoon Seok-youl (presidential candidate) and his unstable diplomatic and security standpoint. \n\nHowever, if contrary to my intentions, my remarks have caused any misunderstanding to the Ukrainian people, I apologize profoundly for my lack of clarity and expressiveness. \n\nAs I believe through the TV debate, I did not have enough time to thoroughly explain my perspective on the current situation, I would like to take the opportunity to do so now. \n\nFirst and foremost, I fully and strongly support the Ukrainian people and their government. I admire their effort to seek peace and freedom and continue to protect their history, culture, and tradition. \n\nI believe that state sovereignty, independence, and territorial preservation must be respected. This is in fact, guaranteed by the UN and international law. Russia’s invasion can not, at all costs, be justified. \n\nAs a Presidential candidate who may be in the future, responsible for the sovereignty and territorial preservation of the Republic of Korea, I strongly condemn Russia’s invasion. Furthermore, I urge Russia to withdraw its troops from Ukraine immediately. \n\nIn addition, I believe Korea should actively take part in Ukraine's seeking to regain sovereignty and comply with territorial preservation precedents in international law to effectively restore peace.\n\nFollowing the Cold War, the 2021–2022 Russo-Ukrainian crisis is one of the most serious diplomatic and security challenges currently facing the international community. \n\nThis war will not only have a significant impact on the relationship between the U.S. and Russia, U.S. and Europe, and Europe and Russia but also, according to circumstances, on the U.S. and China relationship.  \n\nIn addition to rising energy and raw material prices, the war entails Korea’s dire need to participate in the international community's response and sanction movement against Russia’s acts of aggression.\n\nFacing such a situation, I’ve become keenly aware, once more, of the important role peace has. I have also deeply reflected on the importance of proper deterrence, cooperation, and alliance to protect such peace. \n\nIn that respect, I find presidential candidate Yoon Seok-youl’s remarks extremely disappointing. Candidate Yoon is, unfortunately, using the current Ukraine crisis as an opportunity to justify his preemptive strike and nuclear weapon sharing theory and criticize President Moon and me.  \n\nPrior to the TV debate, Yoon through his SNS mocked the government of an ally facing an unfortunate situation through remarks such as, “Ukraine solely depended on the “Budapest Memorandum of Understanding” and “instead of giving up nuclear weapons, Ukraine chose to join NATO instead.” \n\nIt makes me question whether such an individual who instead of seeking to support a country facing a tragic situation, chooses to share cynical remarks is appropriate for the role of a nation’s leader. \n\nThis is the problematic attitude of a novice politician that I pointed out in the TV debate. \n\nI sincerely hope that the military attacks in Ukraine will cease as soon as possible and that a diplomatic solution will be eminently prepared. I support Ukraine’s strive for peace and genuinely hope for the Ukrainian people’s safety and well-being. ","comments":[{"author":"SYSTEM","title":"Post source","content":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/t2kl7l/south_koreas_democratic_party_candidate_lees/","comments":[]}]},{"timestamp":1645973505798,"author":"reddit:CombatFootage/wpxb","title":"STATUS UPDATE: USERS STILL ABUSING SUB AUTOMOD (brigading)","content":"READ TITLE. \n\nUSERS ARE FULL SWING performing a MILITARY ASSAULT on r/CombatFootage \n\nTHESE are DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS who are STUCK IN VIETNAM \n\nthey want POWER. \n\n\ndon’t let them take our posts. don’t let them send false reports to get our content deleted. \n\nwe shall report them too !! \n\n\n\nsource: CHECK AVAILABLE TAGS.
